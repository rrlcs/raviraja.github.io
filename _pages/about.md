About Me
=========

![image](https://rrlcs.github.io/images/iisc.jpg)
I am an M. Tech. Research student at Indian Institute of Science in the Department of Computer Science and Automation. My research interest are in the area of Program Synthesis using Machine Learning. I am being advised jointly by [Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/) and [Prof. Deepak D'Souza](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~deepakd/). I joined IISc through 2019 summer admissions in the Intelligent Systems pool.
